      <p>I added links to sample programming techniques using Flash, XHTML, and ASP to the site today.  
	     I found out that I have to get the site hosting administrator to turn on services for SQL, and then I have to 
		 figure out the Connect string before the last link will work.  It may take me a few days to get that done.
